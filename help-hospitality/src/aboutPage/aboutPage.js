          SNYCR was born out of kinship and appreciation for NYC's restaurants.
          As someone who spent over a decade working in a myriad of spaces
          throughout the city, I know the refuge restaurants provide, for guests
          and staff alike. My story would not be the same without these spaces
          nor would the story of countless others who have had so many
          significant moments originate in these spaces.
          <p />
          In an effort to help, this site was created to give restaurants
          another platform to share their information and provide restaurant
          workers with a list of helpful resources. The database was created to
          allow patrons to quickly browse for and connect with their favorite
          spaces, learn about their current situation and learn how they can provide
          support.
          <p />
          While none of us know what things will look like once this quarantine
          is over, we can still help to make sure that our favorite spaces
          remain part of the new landscape.
